# Feature roadmap — Cloudflare API coverage

Working tracker. Update the status of a batch as work lands so a fresh session
can pick up mid-stream without re-deriving anything.

Endpoint counts come from `docs/cf-api/` (generated from Cloudflare's OpenAPI
schema — `npm run cf:schema && npm run cf:docs`). Coverage was measured by
comparing those paths against the request templates in
`services/cloudflare.ts`.

Status: `todo` · `wip` · `done`

Goal: cover every Cloudflare product a zone/account owner would want to manage
from a phone. Radar, Magic Transit/WAN, DEX, brand-protection and the internal
`*_other` groups are explicitly out of scope — they are either read-only
research data or enterprise network products with no mobile use case.

Multiple agents may work on different batches at once — see "Running multiple
batches in parallel" and `docs/AGENTS_ACTIVE.md` before starting one.

---

## Tier 1 — make what we already show writable

These screens exist but are read-only or shallow. Highest value per unit of
work because the navigation is already there.

| # | Batch | Status | Scope |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Email Routing | done | disable routing, DNS-record check, rule editor, drop/worker actions, multi-destination forward, catch-all editor, delete destination |
| 2 | WAF / Zone Rulesets write | done | create/edit/delete custom rules in `http_request_firewall_custom`, IP Access rule create/delete, legacy firewall rule toggle/delete |
| 3 | Worker scripts | done | view script content, secrets, cron triggers, deployments/versions, settings & bindings. Zone-level routes CRUD API done, screen deferred. Tail already worked |
| 4 | Zone Settings depth | done | 14/14. Brotli, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, 0-RTT, WebSockets, IPv6, HSTS, Early Hints, Rocket Loader, browser cache TTL, Browser Integrity Check |
| 5 | DNS depth | done | 14/14. DNS settings (SOA, NS, CNAME flatten, multi-provider), record scan, record usage/quota, secondary DNS API |
| 6 | R2 depth | done | 14/29. CORS, lifecycle rules, custom domains, public access toggle, bucket locks |
| 7 | Pages depth | done | 5/8 plus Pages Deployment (9) plus Pages Custom Domains (5). Deployment list, retry, rollback, delete; custom domain add/delete |
| 8 | Audit Logs depth | done | 7/7. Filtering by action type, actor email, actor IP; account vs user scope toggle |
| 9 | Zone lifecycle | done | Implemented zone pause/activate, plan management, zone holds, and nameserver re-check. API functions in `services/cloudflare.ts` (getAvailablePlans, getAvailablePlan, changeZonePausedStatus, rerunActivationCheck), UI in `app/zone/[id]/lifecycle.tsx` with tabbed interface for status/plan/hold management, route registration in `app/zone/[id]/_layout.tsx`, tile in `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`, and translations for 12 locales.
| 55 | Worker routes screen | done | Zone-level Worker routes CRUD screen. API (`getWorkerRoutes` / `createWorkerRoute` / `updateWorkerRoute` / `deleteWorkerRoute`) already existed from batch 3 — created UI in `app/zone/[id]/worker-routes.tsx` with full CRUD functionality, translations for 12 locales, and tile in zone index |

## Tier 2 — products with zero coverage that fit the app

| # | Batch | Status | Endpoints | Scope |
|---|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 10 | Health Checks | done | 15 | Full CRUD. Pairs with the existing premium Monitoring feature |
| 11 | Lists | done | 11 | IP / hostname / ASN lists, used by WAF rules |
| 12 | Rules (transform, redirect, cache) | done | Transform rules, redirect rules, and cache rules via Account and Zone Rulesets. Implemented API functions in `services/cloudflare.ts` (getTransformRules, getRedirectRules, getCacheRules, updateTransformRules, updateRedirectRules, updateCacheRules), UI in `app/zone/[id]/rules.tsx` with tabbed interface for different rule types, route registration in `app/zone/[id]/_layout.tsx`, zone index tile in `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`, and translations for 12 locales.
| 13 | Zone Cache Settings | done | 6/9 | Cache Reserve (toggle + clear), Regional Tiered Cache toggle. `variants` (per-image-format MIME config, 3 endpoints) explicitly out of scope — rarely customized |
| 14 | Cloudflare Tunnel | done | 10/20+9. Tunnel list, get, create, delete, connections, token, config (get/put), ingress rules |
| 15 | Registrar | done | 3 | Domain list, auto-renew, lock, WHOIS privacy. Domain purchase/registration (12 more endpoints under `registrar/registrations`) explicitly out of scope — commerce flow, not management |
| 16 | Load Balancers | done | 15/38. Pools CRUD, monitors CRUD, load balancers CRUD with tabbed UI |
| 17 | Waiting Room | done | 6/24. Room list, get, create, update, delete, status |
| 18 | Web Analytics | done | 5/15. Site list, get, create, update, delete |
| 19 | Observatory | todo | 10 | Lighthouse-style speed tests and trends per page |
| 20 | Notification policies + webhooks | done | 8/8 + 5/5 | Policy list, toggle, delete; webhook destination CRUD. New-policy creation out of scope — filter shape differs per alert type, no good picker for mobile |
| 21 | Custom Hostnames (SaaS) | done | 4/8 | List, create (Cloudflare-managed cert), delete, ownership-verification record display. Certificate-pack cert management (2 endpoints) and bring-your-own-cert upload (part of create) out of scope |
| 22 | Page Shield | done | 9/13 | Settings toggle, connections list, cookies list, policy CRUD. Single-item detail GETs (connection/cookie/policy by id) skipped — list responses already carry every field |
| 23 | Zone Snippets | done | 6/8 | List/delete snippets, full snippet-rules CRUD (which snippet runs for which expression). Snippet code upload (multipart JS file) out of scope — no mobile code editor |
| 24 | Zaraz | done | 4/10 | Overview (tool/trigger/variable counts), 3 safe top-level flag toggles, history list + restore. Per-tool config CRUD out of scope — 60+ tool types, each a different schema |
| 25 | Turnstile | done | 6 | Widget CRUD and rotation |
| 26 | Origin CA / Custom Certificates | done | 3/4 + 3/6 + 4/5 | Origin CA full CRUD (CSR has no private key — safe to paste). Certificate Packs + mTLS view/delete only — ordering/uploading needs payment or a private key, out of scope |
| 27 | API Tokens | done | 6/8 | User tokens: list, view, enable/disable, roll, delete. Account-owned tokens (separate 8-endpoint product) and new-token creation (needs a permission-group picker) explicitly out of scope for this batch |
| 28 | Account members & roles | done | 5 | 5/5. Invite, change role, remove |
| 29 | Logpush | done | 4/12 (zone only) | Zone-level job list, enable/disable, delete, error status. Job creation (destination URI + credentials + ownership-challenge flow) out of scope. Account-level Logpush (separate 12-endpoint product) deferred |
| 30 | Log Explorer | done | 5/10 (zone only) | Dataset list/available/create/enable-toggle, SQL query runner. Account-level (separate identical-shaped product) deferred |

## Tier 3 — developer-platform products

| # | Batch | Status | Endpoints | Scope |
|---|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 31 | Queues | done | 5/25. Queue list, get, create, update, delete |
| 32 | Durable Objects | done | 2/2 | Namespace list + object list — the only two endpoints the API exposes. No create/delete: namespaces are provisioned by deploying a Worker with a Durable Object binding, not through the REST API |
| 33 | Hyperdrive | done | 4/7 | List, get, delete, restart. Create/update excluded — both require pasting raw DB origin credentials (host/user/password), same category as the mTLS cert+key upload we scope out elsewhere |
| 34 | Vectorize | done | 9/14 | List/create/get/delete index, index info, metadata index list/create/delete, delete/get vectors by ID. Insert, upsert, query excluded — need raw float-array vectors or an ndjson body, not practical on a mobile keyboard |
| 35 | Workers AI | done | 2/8. Model search/list, run model |
| 36 | AI Gateway | done | 5/23. Gateway list, get, create, update, delete |
| 37 | AI Search (AutoRAG) | done | 6/~90 | Most complex schema in the app — 60+ config fields per instance (chunking, embedding/rerank/rewrite model pickers, cache, retrieval, web-crawler config). Covered: list/get/delete instance, pause/resume toggle, stats, live search box. Instance create/update, chat completions, namespaces variant, jobs, items, tokens, and deprecated AutoRAG endpoints out of scope — no mobile-friendly form fits that much nested config |
| 38 | Workflows | done | 4/24. Workflow list, get, delete, instances |
| 39 | Secrets Store | done | 12/12 | Full coverage — quota, store CRUD, secret CRUD (create/patch/delete/bulk-delete). Clean small schema, secret values write-only and never echoed back (like Turnstile secrets) |
| 40 | Workers for Platforms | done | 12/26 | Dispatch namespace CRUD (list/create/get/patch/delete), script list/get/delete, read-only script content view, script secrets list/add/delete. Script upload (multipart module), script settings PATCH (huge nested config), assets-upload-session, tags, and bindings out of scope |
| 41 | Pipelines | done | 2/19. Pipeline list, delete |

## Tier 4 — media and edge extras

| # | Batch | Status | Endpoints | Scope |
|---|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 42 | Stream | done | 3/34. Video list, get, delete |
| 43 | Images | done | 2/25. Image list, delete |
| 44 | Web3 Hostnames | done | 2/12. Hostname list, delete |
| 45 | Spectrum | done | 2/7. App list, delete |
| 46 | DNS Firewall | done | 2/7. Cluster list, delete |
| 47 | Address Maps / BYOIP | done | 2/19. Address map list, delete |
| 48 | Resource Tagging | done | 3/10. Get tags, set tags, delete tags |

## Tier 5 — Zero Trust (large; likely its own section in the app)

| # | Batch | Status | Endpoints | Scope |
|---|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 49 | Access applications | done | 7/9 (account only) | List/get/create/update/delete app (self_hosted type: name/domain/session_duration/app_launcher_visible), revoke tokens, settings toggle (allow_iframe/skip_interstitial). `policies` sub-object and user_policy_checks test endpoint out of scope — policies need a group-reference picker, same complexity class as Zaraz's per-tool configs. Zone-level Access applications (separate 9-endpoint product) not touched |
| 50 | Access identity providers | todo | 8 | IdP list and config |
| 51 | Access service tokens / mTLS | todo | 7 + 8 | Token and certificate management |
| 52 | Gateway rules & lists | done | 5/9 | List/get/create rule (name/description/action/filters/traffic-expression/enabled); update limited to name/description/enabled/precedence — the API's own PATCH only accepts those 4 fields, action/filters/traffic/identity/device_posture are create-time only; delete. `rule_settings` (30+ type-specific fields: browser isolation, DLP, egress, DNS resolvers, block pages) and bulk-patch-multiple out of scope, same complexity class as AI Search. "Lists" half not found as a distinct product — reuses the account-level Lists product from batch 11 |
| 53 | Zero Trust accounts / users / devices | todo | 13 + 10 + 26 | Org config, user list, enrolled devices |
| 54 | Infrastructure Access targets | done | 5/8 | List/get/create/update/delete target (hostname + IPv4/IPv6). Batch create/delete and deprecated batch-delete out of scope — redundant with single delete for mobile one-off management |

## Explicitly out of scope

Radar (HTTP, DNS, BGP, AS112, attack layers, email) — public research data, not
account management. Magic Transit / WAN / IPsec / PCAP / Network Monitoring,
DEX, Brand Protection, Security Center RFI, DLP, Email Security, Cloud
Integrations, Resource Sharing, Organizations/Tenants, and the internal
`dos-flowtrackd-api_other` / `brapi` / `tseng-*` groups.

---

## Batch 1 — Email Routing (done)

- [x] `disableEmailRouting`, `getEmailRoutingDns` in `services/cloudflare.ts`
- [x] Typed `EmailMatcher` / `EmailAction` / `EmailActionType`
- [x] Rewrote `app/zone/[id]/email.tsx`: rule editor (create + edit), action
      picker (forward / worker / drop), multi-destination forward, catch-all
      editor, delete destination address, DNS-record card, disable routing
- [x] Icons: `chevron-up`, `copy`, `power`
- [x] Translations for the new `email.*` keys across 12 locales
- [x] Typecheck + commit

## Batch 2 — WAF / Zone Rulesets write (done)

- [x] API: `createRulesetRule`, `updateRulesetRule`, `deleteRulesetRule`,
      `getZoneRuleset`, `createWAFEntrypoint`, plus `createIPAccessRule`,
      `updateIPAccessRule`, `deleteIPAccessRule`
- [x] Typed `Ruleset`, `RulesetRule`, `RulesetAction`, `IPAccessRule`, `IPAccessMode`
- [x] Rewrote `app/zone/[id]/firewall.tsx` into three managed sections: WAF
      custom rules (create/edit/toggle/delete with expression templates), IP
      access rules (create/delete), legacy firewall rules (toggle/delete)
- [x] Translations for the new `firewall.*` keys across 12 locales
- [x] Typecheck + commit

## Batch 3 — Worker scripts (done)

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `WorkerSecret`, `WorkerSchedule`,
      `WorkerDeployment` (incl. `annotations`), `WorkerVersion`,
      `WorkerBinding`, `WorkerSettings`, `WorkerSubdomain`, `WorkerRoute`
- [x] Functions: `getWorkerContent`, `getWorkerSettings`, `getWorkerSecrets`,
      `putWorkerSecret`, `deleteWorkerSecret`, `getWorkerSchedules`,
      `putWorkerSchedules`, `getWorkerDeployments`, `getWorkerVersions`,
      `createWorkerDeployment`, `getWorkerSubdomain`, `setWorkerSubdomain`,
      `createWorkerRoute`, `updateWorkerRoute`, `deleteWorkerRoute` — all
      verified against `docs/cf-api/worker-script.md`,
      `docs/cf-api/worker-cron-trigger.md`, `docs/cf-api/worker-deployments.md`,
      `docs/cf-api/worker-versions.md`, `docs/cf-api/worker-routes.md`
- [x] New screen `app/worker/[script].tsx`: overview (compat date, usage
      model, bindings, workers.dev subdomain toggle), code viewer (raw
      multipart content + copy button), secrets (add/overwrite/delete — values
      never re-shown, matching the API), cron triggers (add/delete against the
      full-list-replace endpoint), recent deployments, versions list with
      deploy/rollback via a 100%-traffic deployment
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `worker/[script]` route
- [x] `app/(tabs)/services.tsx` — worker row now pushes to `/worker/[script]`
      (detail screen) instead of straight to the tail; the detail screen links
      on to `/worker-tail/[script]` for live logs
- [ ] Zone-level Worker routes CRUD screen — deferred as batch 55; the API is
      already done
- [x] Translations: 35 `worker.*` keys + `common.copy` across all 12 locales
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 4 — Zone Settings depth (done)

- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/settings.tsx` with10 zone settings: Brotli,
      HTTP/2, HTTP/3, 0-RTT, WebSockets, IPv6, Early Hints, Rocket Loader,
      Browser Integrity Check, HSTS (security_header toggle), plus browser
      cache TTL picker
- [x] Uses existing `getZoneSettings`/`updateZoneSetting` from
      `services/cloudflare.ts` — no new API functions needed
- [x] Added tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx` zone menu grid
- [x] Registered `settings` route in `app/zone/[id]/_layout.tsx`
- [x] Translations: `zone_settings.*` namespace + `zone.zone_settings` /
      `zone.zone_settings_desc` across all 12 locales
- [x] Fixed pre-existing TS error in `deleteListItems` (axios `delete` generic)
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 5 — DNS depth (done)

- [x] API functions in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `DnsZoneSettings`,
      `getDnsSettings`, `updateDnsSettings`, `DnsRecordUsage`,
      `getDnsRecordUsage`, `scanDnsRecords`, `triggerDnsScan`,
      `reviewDnsScan`, `applyDnsScanResults`, `DnsBatchResult`,
      `batchDnsRecords`, `SecondaryDnsZone`, `getSecondaryDnsOutgoing`,
      `createSecondaryDnsOutgoing`, `updateSecondaryDnsOutgoing`,
      `deleteSecondaryDnsOutgoing`, `enableSecondaryDnsOutgoing`,
      `disableSecondaryDnsOutgoing`, `forceSecondaryDnsNotify`,
      `getSecondaryDnsOutgoingStatus` — verified against
      `docs/cf-api/dns-settings-for-a-zone.md`,
      `docs/cf-api/dns-records-for-a-zone.md`,
      `docs/cf-api/secondary-dns-primary-zone.md`
- [x] Enhanced `app/zone/[id]/dns.tsx`: DNS Settings modal (SOA, NS TTL,
      CNAME flattening, multi-provider, secondary overrides), record scan
      button, record usage/quota display
- [x] Translations: 26 `dns.*` keys across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 6 — R2 depth (done)

- [x] API functions in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `R2CorsRule`, `getR2Cors`,
      `putR2Cors`, `deleteR2Cors`, `R2LifecycleRule`, `getR2Lifecycle`,
      `putR2Lifecycle`, `R2CustomDomain`, `getR2CustomDomains`,
      `addR2CustomDomain`, `deleteR2CustomDomain`, `R2PublicAccess`,
      `getR2PublicAccess`, `putR2PublicAccess`, `R2BucketLockRule`,
      `getR2BucketLocks`, `putR2BucketLocks` — verified against
      `docs/cf-api/r2-bucket.md`
- [x] Enhanced `app/r2/[bucket].tsx`: bucket settings modal with public
      access (r2.dev) toggle, custom domains list, CORS rules list,
      lifecycle rules list, bucket locks list
- [x] Translations: 17 `r2.*` keys across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 8 — Audit Logs depth (done)

- [x] API: enhanced `getAuditLogs` with filter params (actionType, actorEmail,
      actorIp, since, before) and added `getUserAuditLogs` for user-scope
      — verified against `docs/cf-api/audit-logs.md`
- [x] Enhanced `app/audit-logs.tsx`: account/user scope toggle, filter panel
      (action type, actor email, actor IP), applied filters indicator
- [x] Translations: 7 `audit.*` keys across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 9 — Zone lifecycle (done)

- [x] API functions in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `pauseZone`, `unpauseZone`,
      `checkActivation`, `ZoneHold`, `getZoneHold`, `createZoneHold`,
      `updateZoneHold`, `deleteZoneHold` — verified against
      `docs/cf-api/zone.md` and `docs/cf-api/zone-holds.md`
- [x] Enhanced `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`: zone pause toggle, zone hold toggle,
      activation check button (all wrapped in `Promise.allSettled` pattern)
- [x] Translations: 12 `zone.*` keys across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (pre-existing errors in `rules.tsx` from
      another batch)

## Batch 10 — Health Checks (done)

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `HealthCheck`, `HealthCheckInput`,
      `HealthCheckType`, `HealthCheckStatus`, `HealthCheckHttpConfig`,
      `HealthCheckTcpConfig` — verified against `docs/cf-api/health-checks.md`
      and the raw schema (`healthchecks_healthchecks` resource) since the
      generated docs only showed the first `oneOf` variant for GET/POST
      responses
- [x] Functions: `getHealthChecks`, `getHealthCheck`, `createHealthCheck`,
      `updateHealthCheck`, `deleteHealthCheck`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/health-checks.tsx`: list with status badge
      (healthy/unhealthy/suspended/unknown), type badge, suspend toggle,
      delete, failure reason when present; add sheet for name/address/type
      (HTTP/HTTPS/TCP) with path for HTTP(S)
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid (zone-scoped
      route, no `app/_layout.tsx` registration needed)
- [x] Translations: 16 `health_checks.*` keys + `zone.health_checks` /
      `zone.health_checks_desc` across all 12 locales
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

Not done in this batch: linking Health Checks to the existing premium
Monitoring feature (e.g. surfacing check status in the monitoring dashboard).
The Scope column mentioned this as a pairing opportunity, not a requirement —
flagging it as a possible follow-up rather than expanding this batch's scope.

## Batch 11 — Lists (done)

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `CFList`, `ListKind`, `ListItem`,
      `ListItemInput`, `ListHostname`, `ListRedirect`, `ListBulkOperation` —
      the 4 list-item variants (ip/hostname/asn/redirect) were verified
      against the raw schema (`lists_item_asn`, `lists_item_hostname`,
      `lists_item_redirect`) since the generated docs only showed the first
      `oneOf` variant
- [x] Functions: `getLists`, `createList`, `updateList`, `deleteList`,
      `getListItems`, `createListItems`, `deleteListItems`,
      `getListBulkOperation`. Item writes are asynchronous on Cloudflare's
      side (return an `operation_id`, not the items) — the screen polls
      `getListBulkOperation` every 1.5s until it leaves `pending`/`running`
- [x] `deleteListItems` calls the client directly instead of the shared `del`
      helper, because DELETE-with-body isn't something that helper supports
- [x] New screens: `app/lists.tsx` (list of lists — create/delete, kind
      picker) and `app/lists/[list].tsx` (items — add/delete, form adapts to
      the list's kind: IP/CIDR, hostname + exclude-exact toggle, ASN number,
      or source/target URL pair for redirects)
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `lists` and `lists/[list]` routes
- [x] Linked from Settings via a new "Lists" menu item
- [x] Translations: 32 `lists.*` keys + `settings.lists` / `settings.lists_sub`
      across all 12 locales, generated with the new
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js` (see below) instead of hand-written tables
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 15 — Registrar (done)

Scoped down from the original estimate. `docs/cf-api/registrar-domains.md` (3
endpoints: list/get/update a domain already registered through Cloudflare —
auto-renew, lock, WHOIS privacy) is what this batch covers.
`docs/cf-api/registrar-registration.md` (12 endpoints, `registrar/registrations`
+ a sandbox mirror) is the domain **purchase** flow — contacts, postal info,
years, pricing. That's a commerce flow with real money and legal/registrant
data, not a management feature, and out of scope for this app; left untouched.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `RegistrarDomain`, `RegistrarTransferIn`
      — response schema in the generated docs was underspecified (bare
      `object`), so fields came from the raw `registrar-api_domain_properties`
      / `registrar-api_domain_update_properties` schemas. `auto_renew` and
      `privacy` are typed optional since the list/get schema doesn't confirm
      they're always present, only that the update endpoint accepts them
- [x] Functions: `getRegistrarDomains`, `getRegistrarDomain`, `updateRegistrarDomain`
- [x] New screen `app/registrar.tsx`: domain cards with expiry countdown
      (badge when ≤30 days out), auto-renew/lock/WHOIS-privacy toggles,
      registry status string
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `registrar` route
- [x] Linked from Settings via a new "Domains" menu item
- [x] Translations: 9 `registrar.*` keys + `settings.registrar` /
      `settings.registrar_sub` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 25 — Turnstile (done)

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `TurnstileWidget`, `TurnstileMode`,
      `TurnstileClearanceLevel`. `secret` is typed optional on the resource —
      it's only present in the create/get-by-sitekey/rotate responses per the
      schema, never on the list response
- [x] Functions: `getTurnstileWidgets`, `getTurnstileWidget`,
      `createTurnstileWidget`, `updateTurnstileWidget`, `deleteTurnstileWidget`,
      `rotateTurnstileSecret`
- [x] New screen `app/turnstile.tsx`: widget cards (name, domains, mode badge,
      site key with copy-to-clipboard), create sheet (name, comma-separated
      domains, mode picker), rotate secret and delete actions. The secret is
      shown once in an alert right after create/rotate, matching that the API
      never returns it again afterward
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `turnstile` route
- [x] Linked from Settings via a new "Turnstile" menu item
- [x] Translations: 19 `turnstile.*` keys + `settings.turnstile` /
      `settings.turnstile_sub` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] **Fixed `scripts/i18n-translate.js`**: the first run translated the
      brand name "Turnstile" itself into the dictionary word it's spelled like
      in each language (e.g. Japanese 改札口 / a ticket gate) instead of
      leaving it as the product name. Added a `BRAND_NAMES` list that's
      protected the same way as `{{placeholders}}` before the text is sent to
      the translate endpoint. Re-ran, spot-checked several locales
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (as of this batch's own files — see note below
      about a concurrent, unrelated error in `app/r2/[bucket].tsx`)

Note: while finishing this batch, `npx tsc --noEmit` twice showed errors in
`app/r2/[bucket].tsx` (JSX and missing style keys) that are not part of this
batch. `docs/AGENTS_ACTIVE.md` shows batch 6 (R2 depth) claimed and in
progress by another agent at the same time — left untouched rather than
editing someone else's in-flight work; that agent's own batch-6 completion
should leave the repo typecheck-clean.

## Batch 28 — Account members & roles (done)

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `AccountRole`. `AccountMember` already
      existed in `services/types.ts`
- [x] Functions: `getAccountRoles`, `inviteAccountMember`,
      `updateAccountMemberRoles`, `removeAccountMember`. The invite and update
      endpoints take different role shapes per the raw schema — invite takes
      `roles: string[]` (role IDs), update takes `roles: object[]` (full role
      objects: id/name/description/permissions) — confirmed against the raw
      `iam_create-member-with-roles` / `iam_update-member-with-roles` schemas
      since the generated docs only showed the first `oneOf` variant for both
      and, confusingly, showed different-looking "first" variants for each
- [x] New screen `app/account-members.tsx`: member list with status badge and
      role chips, invite sheet (email + multi-select role picker), edit-roles
      sheet reusing the same picker, remove member with confirm
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `account-members` route
- [x] Linked from Settings via a new "Members" menu item
- [x] Translations: 13 `account_members.*` keys + `settings.account_members` /
      `settings.account_members_sub` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 27 — API Tokens (done)

Scoped to the user's own tokens (`docs/cf-api/user-api-tokens.md`, 8
endpoints). Account-owned tokens (`docs/cf-api/account-owned-api-tokens.md`,
a separate 8-endpoint product) were left for a future batch rather than
doubling this one's scope. Creating a brand-new token was also left out —
the create request needs a permission-group picker, and `docs/cf-api/` shows
there are hundreds of permission groups across 8 categories; picking a
reasonable subset and scoping resources to them is a form that doesn't fit a
phone screen well without real design work.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `APIToken`, `APITokenPolicy`,
      `APITokenCondition`, `APITokenStatus`
- [x] Functions: `getAPITokens`, `getAPIToken`, `updateAPIToken`,
      `deleteAPIToken`, `rollAPIToken`. `updateAPIToken` sends the full token
      object back (not just the changed field) because the endpoint is a PUT
      that replaces the resource — a partial body risks the API dropping
      policies it wasn't told to keep
- [x] Did not duplicate the existing `verifyToken()` — the docs list a
      `GET /user/tokens/verify` with no path parameter (verifies whichever
      token is making the request), not a per-token-by-id verify endpoint
- [x] New screen `app/api-tokens.tsx`: token list with status badge,
      last-used/expiry dates, enable/disable toggle (PUT with status
      flipped), roll (regenerates the secret, copies the new value to
      clipboard, shown once), delete
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `api-tokens` route
- [x] Linked from Settings via a new "API Tokens" menu item
- [x] Translations: 17 `api_tokens.*` keys + `settings.api_tokens` /
      `settings.api_tokens_sub` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`. First pass mistranslated "Roll" (Cloudflare
      jargon for regenerating a token's secret) literally as "roll" (like a
      rolling die or a paper roll) in every locale — not a brand name, so the
      `BRAND_NAMES` list didn't catch it. Fixed by rewording the English
      source to "Regenerate" and retranslating just those 3 keys, which reads
      correctly everywhere it was spot-checked. Note for future batches:
      jargon words that are also common nouns (roll, purge, flush, ...) need
      the same rewording treatment placeholders/brand names get
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 7 — Pages depth (done)

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `PagesDeployment`, `PagesDeploymentStage`,
      `PagesDeployStage`, `PagesDeployStageStatus`, `PagesDomain`,
      `PagesDomainStatus`
- [x] Functions: `getPagesDeployments`, `getPagesDeployment`,
      `deletePagesDeployment`, `retryPagesDeployment`,
      `rollbackPagesDeployment`, `getPagesDeploymentLogs`, `getPagesDomains`,
      `addPagesDomain`, `deletePagesDomain`. Retry and rollback both take no
      request body and return the full deployment resource, confirmed against
      the raw schema
- [x] New screen `app/pages/[project].tsx`: deployment list (environment +
      stage-status badges, commit message, branch/trigger, timestamp) with
      retry/rollback/delete per deployment, plus a custom-domains section
      (add/delete) below it
- [x] `app/(tabs)/services.tsx` — Pages project rows now push to the new
      screen instead of being static cards
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `pages/[project]` route
- [x] Translations: 28 `pages.*` keys across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

Not done: deployment build logs (`getPagesDeploymentLogs` exists but isn't
wired into the screen — the log payload shape needs a dedicated viewer and
this batch prioritized the higher-value retry/rollback/domains actions).

## Batch 13 — Zone Cache Settings (done)

Scoped to Cache Reserve and Regional Tiered Cache. `variants` (per-image-format
MIME overrides for avif/bmp/gif/jp2/jpeg/jpg/jpg2/png/tif/tiff/webp — 3
endpoints) is out of scope: it's a config object almost no zone customizes,
and the ROADMAP scope line's higher-value items (tiered cache, cache reserve)
are both covered.

- [x] Functions in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `getCacheReserve`,
      `updateCacheReserve`, `getCacheReserveClearStatus`,
      `startCacheReserveClear`, `getRegionalTieredCache`,
      `updateRegionalTieredCache`. Reused the existing `ZoneSetting` type for
      the two toggles; added `CacheReserveClearStatus` for the async clear job
- [x] Extended `app/zone/[id]/cache.tsx` (existing screen) rather than adding
      a new one: settings card with both toggles, a Clear Cache Reserve
      button that only shows once Cache Reserve is on, polling
      `getCacheReserveClearStatus` every 3s while a clear is in progress. Left
      the existing purge-everything / purge-by-URL sections untouched
- [x] Translations: 11 new `cache.*` keys merged into the existing namespace,
      across all 12 locales via `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 20 — Notification policies + webhooks (done)

Scoped to managing existing policies and webhook destinations. Creating a new
alert policy needs an alert-type picker backed by a `filters` shape that's
different per alert type (dozens of possible filter fields across dozens of
alert types, per `docs/cf-api/notification-policies.md`) — building a picker
that only covers a handful of types and silently mishandles the rest isn't
worth shipping; left out.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `NotificationPolicy`,
      `NotificationMechanisms`, `NotificationWebhook`, `WebhookType`
- [x] Functions: `getNotificationPolicies`, `updateNotificationPolicy`
      (PUT replaces the resource, so it sends the full policy back with only
      `enabled` changed), `deleteNotificationPolicy`, `getNotificationWebhooks`,
      `createNotificationWebhook`, `deleteNotificationWebhook`
- [x] New screen `app/notifications.tsx`: policy list (name, alert type,
      enable toggle, delete) and a webhook destinations section (add via
      name+URL, delete)
- [x] `app/_layout.tsx` — registered `notifications` route
- [x] Linked from Settings via a new "Notifications" menu item
- [x] Translations: 14 `notifications.*` keys + `settings.notifications` /
      `settings.notifications_sub` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] **Fixed a two-agent collision**: found `npx tsc --noEmit` broken by
      duplicate `getZoneHold`/`createZoneHold`/`updateZoneHold`/`deleteZoneHold`
      functions — batch 9 (Zone lifecycle) had been implemented once already
      (marked done) and then re-implemented by a second agent under the same
      batch number without checking `docs/AGENTS_ACTIVE.md` first. Removed the
      duplicate block; see `docs/AGENTS_ACTIVE.md` for the full note
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

## Batch 21 — Custom Hostnames / Cloudflare for SaaS (done)

Scoped to the common case: list, create with a Cloudflare-managed certificate
(DCV method + optional wildcard), delete, and showing the ownership
verification record so the zone owner can hand it to their customer.
Bring-your-own-certificate upload (PEM cert/key pasted into the create
request) and the 2 certificate-pack management endpoints (revoking a specific
issued cert) are out of scope — a PEM paste flow isn't a good mobile form, and
per-cert-pack management is a rare follow-up action once a hostname is active.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `CustomHostname`, `CustomHostnameSsl`,
      `CustomHostnameStatus`, `DcvMethod`
- [x] Functions: `getCustomHostnames`, `getCustomHostname`,
      `createCustomHostname`, `deleteCustomHostname`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/custom-hostnames.tsx`: hostname list with
      status badge, tap-to-expand ownership-verification record (name/value,
      copy-to-clipboard), verification error message when present; add sheet
      (hostname, optional origin server override, DCV method picker, wildcard
      toggle)
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid
- [x] Translations: 24 `custom_hostnames.*` keys + `zone.custom_hostnames` /
      `zone.custom_hostnames_desc` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (own files only — `app/zone/[id]/lifecycle.tsx`
      had unrelated errors at the time from another agent's in-progress batch
      9 re-implementation; not this batch's concern, left untouched since it
      was still being actively written)

## Batch 23 — Zone Snippets (done)

Snippet code upload is a `multipart/form-data` request carrying real JS module
files — out of scope, no mobile code editor is worth building for that.
Scoped to: listing/deleting existing snippets, and full CRUD on snippet rules
(which snippet runs for which request, by expression), since a rule only
needs an existing snippet's name and an expression string, no code involved.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `ZoneSnippet`, `SnippetRule`
- [x] Functions: `getZoneSnippets`, `deleteZoneSnippet`, `getSnippetRules`,
      `putSnippetRules` (replaces the whole rules array — every call sends
      the full list, not just the changed rule), `deleteSnippetRules`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/snippets.tsx`: snippet list (delete only —
      no create, per the scoping above) and a rules section (toggle
      enabled, delete, add — picking an existing snippet by name plus an
      expression and optional description)
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid
- [x] Translations: 16 `snippets.*` keys + `zone.snippets` /
      `zone.snippets_desc` across all 12 locales via `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
- [x] **Found and fixed a real machine-translation bug in the translate
      script itself**, not just a wording quirk: the placeholder token
      `XPLACEHOLDERX0X` used to protect `{{vars}}` and brand names is
      word-shaped, and when it ends up as the *entire* untranslated string
      (e.g. `zone.snippets` is just the single word "Snippets", itself a
      protected brand name), several target languages "corrected" the fake
      word instead of passing it through — Spanish and Korean respelled it
      (`XPLACHOLDERX0X`, `XPACEHOLDERX0X`), Chinese literally translated the
      word "PLACEHOLDER" in the middle of the token (`X占位符X0X`). Found this
      by spot-checking `zone.snippets` in zh, then grepped all 12 locale files
      for the corruption pattern and found it had also silently broken
      `turnstile.secret_shown_once`, `custom_hostnames.method_http`, and three
      `snippets.*` keys in es/ko/zh from earlier batches, plus
      `tunnels.title` in es (a different agent's batch 14) — hand-fixed all
      of those seven broken values directly, then changed the placeholder
      format in `scripts/i18n-translate.js` from a word-shaped token to a
      digit-only one (`77330{n}03377`) with no letters for a translator to
      recognize as a word, verified it passes through zh/es/ko untouched.
      **If you used `scripts/i18n-translate.js` before this fix, grep your
      locale files for `OLDERX[0-9]+X` or `占位符` to check for the same
      corruption.**
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (own files; `lifecycle.tsx` errors unrelated,
      see batch 21's note)

## Batch 22 — Page Shield (done)

Scoped to zone settings toggle, connections/cookies monitoring lists, and
policy CRUD. Single-item GET-by-id endpoints for connection/cookie/policy were
skipped — the list endpoints already return every field a detail view would
show, so a detail screen would just be a filtered re-render of data already
in hand.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `PageShieldSettings`,
      `PageShieldConnection`, `PageShieldCookie`, `PageShieldPolicy`,
      `PageShieldPolicyAction`
- [x] Functions: `getPageShieldSettings`, `updatePageShieldSettings`,
      `getPageShieldConnections`, `getPageShieldCookies`,
      `getPageShieldPolicies`, `createPageShieldPolicy`,
      `updatePageShieldPolicy`, `deletePageShieldPolicy`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/page-shield.tsx`: enable toggle, policy list
      (action badge, enable toggle, delete, add sheet with action picker +
      expression field), connections list (malicious flag badge), cookies
      list (type badge)
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid
- [x] Added `"Page Shield"` to `scripts/i18n-translate.js`'s `BRAND_NAMES`
- [x] Translations: 24 `page_shield.*` keys + `zone.page_shield` /
      `zone.page_shield_desc` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`. Re-checked all locale files for the batch
      23 placeholder-corruption pattern (`grep -rn "OLDERX[0-9]\+X\|占位符"
      locales/*.json`) — clean
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (own files; `lifecycle.tsx` errors unrelated,
      see batch 21's note)

## Batch 26 — Origin CA / Custom Certificates (done)

Split-scope batch across three products, each scoped by the same
sensitivity/complexity test used elsewhere in this roadmap:

- **Origin CA** (`docs/cf-api/origin-ca.md`, 4 endpoints): full CRUD. A CSR
  carries no private key — it's the public output of `openssl req` or a
  hosting provider's cert tool — so pasting one in is a normal, safe flow,
  unlike a full cert+key pair
- **Certificate Packs** (Advanced Certificate Manager, 6 endpoints): list, get,
  delete only. Ordering a new pack is a paid product with a validation-method
  + hosts + CA-choice form on top of a billing decision — same reasoning as
  skipping domain registration purchase in batch 15
- **mTLS Certificates** (5 endpoints): list, get, delete only. Uploading one
  needs the actual certificate and optionally its private key pasted in — a
  different risk profile than a CSR, not worth a mobile paste flow

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `OriginCACertificate`,
      `OriginCARequestType`, `OriginCAValidityDays`, `CertificatePack`,
      `CertPackStatus`, `MtlsCertificate`
- [x] Functions: `getOriginCACertificates`, `createOriginCACertificate`,
      `revokeOriginCACertificate`, `getCertificatePacks`,
      `deleteCertificatePack`, `getMtlsCertificates`, `deleteMtlsCertificate`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/certificates.tsx`: three sections — Origin CA
      (list, add via CSR paste + hostnames + key-type picker, revoke),
      Certificate Packs (list with status badge, delete), mTLS Certificates
      (list, delete — only shown when an account ID is available, since it's
      an account-level resource)
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid
- [x] Added `"mTLS"`, `"CSR"`, `"Origin CA"` to `scripts/i18n-translate.js`'s
      `BRAND_NAMES`
- [x] Translations: 32 `certificates.*` keys + `zone.certificates` /
      `zone.certificates_desc` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`. Re-checked for the batch 23
      placeholder-corruption pattern — clean
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (own files; `lifecycle.tsx` errors unrelated,
      see batch 21's note)

## Batch 24 — Zaraz (done)

The full config object (`docs/cf-api/zaraz.md`'s GET/PUT config response) is
enormous: `tools`/`triggers`/`variables` are free-form maps where each tool's
shape differs per the 60+ tool types Zaraz supports (analytics pixels, ad
platforms, custom scripts, ...). Building per-tool-type config forms for all
of them is its own project, not one batch — out of scope. Also out of scope:
`publish` (request body is an untyped `string` with no documented shape to
build a form against) and `workflow` (also an untyped `string`).

Scoped to what's safe and useful without touching per-tool schemas: a
read-only overview (counts), three top-level flag toggles that don't need
any nested-tool knowledge, and configuration history with restore.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `ZarazConfig`, `ZarazHistoryEntry`
- [x] Functions: `getZarazConfig`, `updateZarazConfig` (PUT replaces the
      whole config — every toggle fetches the full object, flips one field,
      and sends the whole thing back, there's no partial-update mode),
      `getZarazHistory`, `restoreZarazHistory`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/zaraz.tsx`: overview card (tools/triggers/
      variables configured counts), settings card (consent management,
      data-layer compatibility, SPA history-change support toggles), history
      list with tap-to-restore
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid (after
      another agent's concurrently-added Waiting Room tile — re-read the file
      before editing to avoid clobbering it)
- [x] Translations: 20 `zaraz.*` keys + `zone.zaraz` / `zone.zaraz_desc`
      across all 12 locales via `scripts/i18n-translate.js`. Corruption
      re-check clean
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (own files; `lifecycle.tsx` errors unrelated,
      see batch 21's note — one of its two error types has since been fixed
      by whoever's working that file)

## Batch 29 — Logpush, zone-level (done)

Scoped to `docs/cf-api/logpush-jobs-for-a-zone.md`, managing existing jobs
only. Creating a job needs `destination_conf` — a URI for an S3/GCS/etc
bucket with credentials embedded — plus an ownership-challenge round trip to
prove control of that destination; that's a per-provider setup best done once
via the dashboard or `wrangler`, not a mobile form. Account-level Logpush
(`docs/cf-api/logpush-jobs-for-an-account.md`, a separate but
identically-shaped 12-endpoint product) is deferred to its own follow-up
batch rather than doubling this one's scope.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `LogpushJob`, `LogpushDataset`
- [x] Functions: `getLogpushJobs`, `getLogpushJob`, `updateLogpushJob`
      (enable/disable only), `deleteLogpushJob`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/logpush.tsx`: job list showing name/dataset,
      destination, a "Failing" badge + error message when `error_message` is
      set, an enable/disable toggle, and delete
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid
- [x] Added `"Logpush"` to `scripts/i18n-translate.js`'s `BRAND_NAMES`
- [x] Translations: 9 `logpush.*` keys + `zone.logpush` / `zone.logpush_desc`
      across all 12 locales via `scripts/i18n-translate.js`. Corruption
      re-check clean
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` fully clean — the `lifecycle.tsx` errors noted in
      batches 21–24 are gone; whoever was working batch 9's re-implementation
      finished it

## Batch 30 — Log Explorer, zone-level (done)

Scoped to `docs/cf-api/log-explorer-datasets.md` and
`docs/cf-api/log-explorer-queries.md`'s zone paths. Account-level (a separate
but identically-shaped product) deferred to a follow-up rather than doubling
scope, same call as batch 29's Logpush split.

- [x] Types in `services/cloudflare.ts`: `LogExplorerField`,
      `LogExplorerDataset`, `LogExplorerAvailableDataset`. Query results are
      typed as `Record<string, unknown>[]` — the schema documents them as
      bare `object[]` with no fixed shape (arbitrary log rows per dataset)
- [x] Functions: `getLogExplorerDatasets`, `getAvailableLogExplorerDatasets`,
      `createLogExplorerDataset`, `updateLogExplorerDataset` (enable/disable),
      `runLogExplorerQuery`
- [x] New screen `app/zone/[id]/log-explorer.tsx`: dataset list with enable
      toggle, add sheet listing only the zone-scoped datasets not already
      added, a query runner (SQL text input) whose results render as
      tap-to-expand JSON rows
- [x] Added a tile to `app/zone/[id]/index.tsx`'s zone menu grid
- [x] Added `"SQL"` to `scripts/i18n-translate.js`'s `BRAND_NAMES`
- [x] Translations: 13 `log_explorer.*` keys + `zone.log_explorer` /
      `zone.log_explorer_desc` across all 12 locales via
      `scripts/i18n-translate.js`. Corruption re-check clean
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` fully clean

## Running multiple batches in parallel

Each batch above is meant to be handed to its own agent
(`.claude/agents/cf-batch.md`) so several can run at once.

**Claim your batch first.** `docs/AGENTS_ACTIVE.md` is the live lock file —
before starting a batch, read it, add a row with your agent name and the
batch number, and mark it `claimed`. Check it again before writing to any of
the three shared files below. Update your row to `done` when you finish.
Never start a batch someone else's row already claims.

Three files are shared across every batch and are the only real collision
risk:

- **`services/cloudflare.ts`** — every batch adds a new `// ─── Name ───`
  section. As long as two batches touch different products, appends do not
  overlap. Never edit a banner or function that belongs to a different,
  in-progress batch — check `docs/AGENTS_ACTIVE.md` for what is currently
  claimed before touching existing code near the bottom of the file. If two
  batches target the *same* product at once, don't parallelize them — merge
  into one batch instead.
- **`locales/*.json`** (12 files) — each batch merges its own new keys under
  its own namespace (`worker.*`, `health_checks.*`, …). Namespaces don't
  collide, but two agents writing the same file at the same wall-clock moment
  can still clobber each other's write. Prefer running the translation step
  serially even when the rest of a batch ran in parallel, or give each
  parallel agent its own git worktree and merge afterward.
- **`app/_layout.tsx`** — route registration is one line per screen; same
  clobber risk as locale files if two agents save it at the same instant.

For real parallelism (not just conceptually independent batches), run each
agent in its own git worktree rather than the same working tree — the Agent
tool's `isolation: "worktree"` option does this automatically. That turns the
shared-file risk into a normal merge instead of a race. Without worktree
isolation, only parallelize batches that touch entirely disjoint files, and
serialize the merge step (locale files, `_layout.tsx`, `ROADMAP.md` status)
after the parallel work finishes.

**A note on shell scripting these edits:** do not pipe JS containing backtick
code-spans (`` `like this` ``) through `node -e "..."` inside a double-quoted
Bash command — the shell resolves backticks as command substitution before
Node ever sees the string, silently corrupting the content (this happened once
in this file's own edit history and truncated several sections). Use the
Write/Edit tools directly for markdown/doc edits, or single-quote the outer
shell string with backtick-free content, instead.

## How to work on this repo

**Do not commit or push** unless the user asks. Leave changes in the working
tree.

**Verify payloads before writing a client.** `docs/cf-api/<product>.md` lists
every endpoint with its request-body fields and the unwrapped `result` shape.
Read the entry before adding a function to `services/cloudflare.ts`. Do not
write payload shapes from memory. Regenerate the docs with
`npm run cf:schema && npm run cf:docs`.

**Conventions in this codebase:**

- API calls live in `services/cloudflare.ts`, grouped by product with a
  `// ─── Name ───` banner. Use the private `get`/`post`/`put`/`patch`/`del`
  helpers; they already unwrap `CFResponse`.
- Screens are Expo Router files under `app/`. Zone-scoped screens live in
  `app/zone/[id]/`, account-scoped ones at the top level.
- UI primitives: `Card`, `Badge`, `Button`, `Loading`, `EmptyState`,
  `SectionHeader`, `Icon` from `components/ui/`. Colours come from
  `useTheme()`, spacing/type from `constants/theme`.
- Adding a new icon means adding both the `case` and the name in the
  `IconName` union in `components/ui/icon.tsx`.
- Editors are bottom-sheet `Modal`s with `animationType="slide"`, an overlay of
  `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`, and a `Button` pinned at the bottom. Copy the pattern from
  `app/zone/[id]/firewall.tsx`.
- Destructive actions use `Alert.alert` with a `destructive` styled button.
- Errors: `e?.response?.data?.errors?.[0]?.message ?? e?.message`.
- Optimistic toggles revert on failure — see `toggleWaf` in firewall.tsx.

**Translations.** All 12 locales in `locales/` must have identical key sets:
en, id, es, pt, de, fr, ru, ja, ko, zh, tr, vi. Use `scripts/i18n-translate.js`
— write only the English strings to a small `{ key: "text" }` file and run
`node scripts/i18n-translate.js <namespace> <source.json>`; it calls Google's
public translate endpoint and merges the result into all 12 locale files,
preserving `{{placeholder}}` tokens, and reports any locale left incomplete.
Do not hand-write a 12-language table — that spends a large number of tokens
on text a translation API produces in seconds. Spot-check a couple of strings
afterward. Never leave a locale short.

**Checks.** `npx tsc --noEmit` must be clean before a batch is considered done.
Do not build an APK or AAB unless the user explicitly asks.
